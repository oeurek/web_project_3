Partying and taking a selfie with a famous rock star, donating $1 to a billionaire to help eradicate polio in Africa, and even stopping by famous author Stephen King's house to say hi and asking him to sign your favorite book.</p>

                    extraordinary and highly underrated state full of rich history and
                    majestic natural beauty. Maine is the main state you want to be sure

                    <p class="places__paragraph">Thankfully, not only is Maine home to the very first European
                    settlers on US territory in the era of Vikings, but is also home to
                    L.L. Bean, which is a great company to grab a super sturdy backpack
                    from for your 3-month expedition.

            There's no better place to lose yourself in nature than in
            springtime New Hampshire. As serene and beautiful as it was in the
            1700s, this state is still much less traveled than its neighbors to
            the South. So enjoy it while it lasts.

            You won't be on your bike the whole time, so doesn't it make sense
            to pick up some extra footwear? Fortunately for you, the best
            outdoor shoe company in the history of the world proudly hails from
            this state. Cycle by the Timberland headquarters in Stratham, and
            pick up a pair of rugged, waterproof boots to keep your feet dry.
            Fitting for unpredictable weather you may be confronted by while
            passing through the Appalachians. These boots are also better than
            cycling shoes when pitching a tent.

            Not only famous for “The Big Apple,” the state of NY also has
            several other reasons for going down in history. Since the late
            1800s Schenectady, “The City that Lights and Hauls the World,” has
            been home to the world-famous General Electric Company.

            This is where modern power generators were born as well as
            contemporary means of transmitting energy. So we figured this would
            be the perfect place to find a batteryless dynamo light for your
            bicycle to help you see through those dark lonely roads on your
            adventure. Such a light from GE will set you back about $10-20.

            Erie, Pennsylvania, not to be confused with the word “eerie,”
            although it can be from time to time, is another town worth passing
            through for several different reasons. While it might be most
            famously known as the scene of the Gettysburg address delivered by
            Mr. Lincoln during the Civil war, Pennsylvania also has produced a
            rather decent-sized Amish community (eerie, huh?)

          <p class="places__paragraph">
            The reason we've brought you here today, if you haven't already
            guessed, can be summed up by using one delicious word: chocolate.
            Hershey's is a Pennsylvania-based company. Most likely, one of the
            tastiest missions you'll ever embark on during this tour, try to
            find an Amish friend and enjoy a bar in the National Wildlife Refuge
            on your way to Erie and have an extra eerie time!

            From the college capital of Columbus to the clean coastline of
            Cleveland, Ohio is a truly hidden gem. Earthquakes are surprisingly
            common in this particular region of North America, over 200 of which
            have registered with a magnitude of 2 or higher since 1776. However,
            earthquakes aren't the only thing shaking this centrally located
            state. One of the country's largest and oldest roller coaster parks
            is waiting to ROCK your world in Sandusky, Ohio! This will
            presumably be one of the most thrilling quests you'll ever complete
            (provided you can stomach it). Take a much-deserved break to ride as
            many roller coasters as you can before continue your bike ride!
